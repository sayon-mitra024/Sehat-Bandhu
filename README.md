## üí° Project Overview and Purpose

**Sehat Bandhu** (meaning "Health Friend") is a comprehensive, AI-powered health assistant designed to democratize access to basic medical information. Developed as a solution for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH 2025), the project addresses critical barriers to healthcare‚Äî**language diversity** and the need for **instant, reliable information**.

The core purpose is to provide an accessible, 24/7 consultation platform that can communicate with users in their native language and issue critical safety warnings for serious symptoms, seamlessly integrating generative AI with a structured knowledge base.

## ‚ú® Key Technical Achievements

This project, developed entirely by a single author, demonstrates advanced, full-stack integration focusing on accessibility and resilience:

1.  **Hybrid Knowledge Architecture:** Implements a two-tier information retrieval system:
    * **Tier 1 (Speed):** Uses a **SQLite3** database for lightning-fast retrieval of official, pre-verified FAQs and quick-response data.
    * **Tier 2 (Intelligence):** Integrates the **Google Gemini Pro API** for sophisticated reasoning, complex query handling, and generating context-aware advice when the database fails to provide a direct match.
2.  **Full Multilingual Bi-Directional Pipeline:** The system automatically detects the user's input language, translates it to English for reliable backend processing, and then translates the final, sanitized response back to the user's native tongue.
3.  **End-to-End Audio Functionality (TTS/STT):**
    * **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** The Flask backend generates audio using `gTTS`, which is **Base64-encoded** and streamed to the frontend via JSON for automatic, instantaneous playback.
    * **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Utilizes the native Web Speech API for hands-free voice input, enhancing accessibility.
4.  **Integrated Safety Protocol:** Employs **SpaCy** and keyword matching to screen for serious medical symptoms (e.g., "chest pain," "difficulty breathing"), overriding the normal flow to issue immediate, non-diagnostic **emergency disclaimers** and contact prompts.

## üíª Code Analysis and Developer's Guide

This guide details the purpose of each file and highlights the key functional blocks, which is crucial for reviewers spending limited time with the codebase.

### 1. `app.py` (Backend Logic & API - Flask/Python)

This is the **controller and business logic hub**. When reading the code, focus on the defined pipeline within the `/chat` route.

| Section (Function Name) | Purpose | Key Technical Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Setup & Utilities** | Initialization, constants, and helper functions like `normalize_text` and `sanitize_text`. | **Input Sanitization** using regex (`re`) is vital to cleaning user and AI-generated text. |
| **Database Functions** | `setup_database`, `fetch_from_db`, `save_to_db`. Handles SQLite persistence and lookups. | Implements **Fuzzy Search** (`difflib`) to ensure high-recall from the internal FAQ database. |
| **Safety Logic** | `is_medical_query` & `has_serious_symptoms`. | **Critical Safety Logic**; checks against a predefined list of high-risk keywords using **SpaCy** to ensure non-diagnostic warnings are prioritized. |
| **`get_bot_response` (The Core)** | Orchestrates the full query flow: **Translate User Query** $\rightarrow$ **DB Check** $\rightarrow$ **Gemini Call** $\rightarrow$ **Translate Bot Response**. | The central **Orchestration** point for multilingual, hybrid AI resolution. |
| **`/chat` Route** | The primary API endpoint. | **Audio Encoding:** Responsible for converting the `gTTS` audio stream into a **Base64 string** for transport within the JSON response. |

### 2. `sehatBandhu.html` (Frontend Interface - HTML/JS)

This is the presentation layer, focused on user interaction, voice input, and audio playback management.

| Section | Purpose | Key Technical Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`<script>` Block: `sendMessage()`** | The core AJAX function. It sends the user text to the backend and **extracts both the `response` text and the `audio` Base64 string** from the JSON response. | **Response Processing:** Retrieves and handles the hybrid text/audio data structure from the Flask server. |
| **`<script>` Block: `playAudio()`** | Decodes the Base64 audio string received from the backend, creates an **in-memory Audio object** (`new Audio()`), and initiates playback. | **Base64 Decoding and Playback:** Direct, client-side handling of the audio stream. |
| **Speech Recognition** | Integration of `window.SpeechRecognition` (Web Speech API). | **Accessibility:** Manages the microphone state and converts user speech into text input. |

### 3. `STYLE.CSS` (Styling - CSS3)

Provides a modern, professional, and responsive aesthetic.

| Section | Purpose | Key Technical Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chatbot Styling** | Styles the chat bubbles, input, and buttons. | Includes the **CSS animation** (`@keyframes pulse`) for the microphone button, providing crucial visual feedback when the microphone is active. |
| **Responsiveness** | Uses media queries (`@media (max-width:768px)`) to optimize the layout. | Ensures the application is functional and aesthetically pleasing across all device sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Execution

To run the project locally, you will need to set up a Python environment and acquire the necessary API key.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.8+**
2.  A **Google Gemini API Key**

### Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sayon-mitra024/Sehat-Bandhu](https://github.com/sayon-mitra024/Sehat-Bandhu)
    cd Sehat-Bandhu
    ```

2.  **Environment Setup:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```
    *(Note: Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies: `flask`, `flask-cors`, `googletrans`, `spacy`, `requests`, and `gtts`.)*

4.  **Configure API Key:**
    Set your Gemini API Key as an environment variable (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) for secure operation.

5.  **Run the Flask Server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will launch on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

6.  **Access the Application:**
    Open the `sehatBandhu.html` file in your web browser and click **Start Chat** to begin interacting.
